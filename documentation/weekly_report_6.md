## Week 6

Work time: 10 hours

I did a little test to see if a command-line based benchmarking tool would run any faster. It did but the difference was minimal. I made a graph to see how the length of the optimal path corresponds to the running time of the algorithms. JavaFX had no support for this so the solution was quite hacky. Clearly Java is not the right language for data visualization.

I did performance testing and wrote documentation.

Next week I will do some final polishing based on peer review, write a user manual and create a Github release.
