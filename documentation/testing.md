## Testing

The program has unit tests implemented with JUnit for trivial cases. The program contains a simple benchmarking utility that can run scenarios defined in a text file that follows Moving AI Labs' scenario file format.

I have conducted some initial testing using a couple of scenarios. The results show that A* is 1.5 times faster than Dijkstra and Jump Point Search is 3 times faster than Dijkstra.
